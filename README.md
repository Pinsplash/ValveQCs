Only models in loose files or VPKs were included (not ones packed in maps).

All Source games released 2004-2007 have an "hl2" folder containing models that are the same as current HL2, except that 6 of the models do not have changes made in the 20th anniversary update. (Except Portal apparently, which does have the up-to-date models?) These older versions of the models were only included in the HL2DM folder.

* `props_foliage/tree_deciduous_card_01`
